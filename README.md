# PomodoroClock

This is a Pomodoro clock I coded myself using ReactJS. The user can: 
- Define a working time
- Define a break time
Then, when the user launched the timer, the working time runs until it reaches zero. Then, an alarm sounds and the break time starts running.
When the break time reaches zero, the working time starts, and so on and so forth.
The user can also:
- Pause the timer
- Reset the timer
